# sports-registration-system
The university wants you to develop a system to maintain student’s registration in different sports such as cricket, football or hockey. The system allows each student to register only for single team, it means students are not allowed to register for two different games. Although a student can switch his registration from one sport to another. 
For instance, a student A was previously registered in cricket team but now he wants to register for football team, in this case his registration will be updated from cricket player to football player. 

Following students are not eligible to register for sports
      Students above 25 years
      Students who are also working as teaching assistant (TA)
